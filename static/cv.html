  <h3>Job history</h3>

    <dt>
      Web developer,
      <a href="http://www.eaudeweb.ro">Eau de Web</a>
      <span class="timeframe">July 2008 &ndash; present</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Web development: Python (Flask, Django, Zope), JavaScript. We do
      consulting for public sector clients (e.g. European Environment
      Agency, World Bank). I talk to clients to learn their needs,
      iterate on implementation, deploy and maintain the applications in
      production, alone or as part of a small team. This provides the
      opportunity to work with a good variety of open source
      technologies, centered around Python web development. I submit
      patches to upstream whenever possible.
    </dd>

      <span class="timeframe">February 2006 &ndash; February 2008</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      iterating.com was a startup where we tried to catalog software
      products. I got to work with RDF (the data was stored using Jena),
      Java servlets, and plain no-framework JavaScript. I was also
      administering the production servers.

      I do system administration for the computer network in a lab (a
